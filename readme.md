### Accounting app Backend

- This project is the backend for account react app that we are creating.


#### Notes:
- We need to install the dependencies first
- We also need to have local mongodb running 
- create a database with name `accountApp` or provide it in environment variable in `MONGODB_URI`.


#### Run with docker/docker-compose

- clone the project
- run `docker-compose up`
- Run the frontend app from the frontend repository (read readme of that repo)
- You are live on `http://localhost:8080` (need postman to work with it. Import `AccountApp.postman_collection.json` in postman)
- If you don't care about what's inside then just run the frontend project and that's it.
