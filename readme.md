### Accounting app Backend

- This project is the backend for account react app that we are creating.


#### Notes:
- We need to install the dependencies first
- We also need to have local mongodb running 
- create a database with name `accountApp` or provide it in environment variable in `MONGODB_URI`.


#### Run with docker/docker-compose (both frontend and backend)

- clone the project
- run `docker-compose up`
- It will also run the frontend app so you dont need to worry about that. (hold tight and pretend it's a plan)
- You are live on `http://localhost:8080` (If you need postman then Import `AccountApp.postman_collection.json` in postman)
- You are also running frontend app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). (Check code for that also. `https://github.com/parthmakadiya12/account-app-test-frontend`)
